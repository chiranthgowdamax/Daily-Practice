# Number Validation with NOT Operator 🚫

A Python program that checks if a number is not divisible by 3 using the logical NOT operator.

## Features
- Accepts any integer as input
- Determines divisibility by 3 using modulo operator
- Uses NOT operator to invert the divisibility condition
- Provides clear validation feedback

## Concepts Used
- Integer input and type conversion
- Logical NOT operator (`not`)
- Modulo operator (`%`) for divisibility checking
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- Boolean logic inversion

## How to Run
```bash
python not_operator_validator.py
