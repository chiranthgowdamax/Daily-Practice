# Conditional Number Printer with Loop Control 

A Python program that prints numbers within a user-specified range with conditional skipping and early termination.

## Features
- Accepts starting and ending numbers as integer inputs
- Iterates through the specified number range
- Skips numbers divisible by 3 using `continue`
- Terminates the loop early if any number exceeds 50 using `break`
- Demonstrates loop control flow mechanisms

## Concepts Used
- Integer input handling
- For loops with user-defined `range()`
- `break` statement for loop termination
- `continue` statement for loop iteration skipping
- Modulo operator (`%`) for divisibility checking
- Conditional statements within loops
- Range boundaries handling

## How to Run
```bash
python conditional_printer.py
