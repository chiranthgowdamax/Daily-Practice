# Daily Practice 🚀

This repository contains my **daily coding practice**, organized **day-wise** to build consistency, clarity, and real skills.

I start from **Day 1** and continue adding folders every day with the code I practice.

Each **Day-XX** folder contains:
- Code written on that day
- Small programs, exercises, or concepts practiced

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Build **daily coding habit**
- Avoid tutorial hell by **writing code every day**
- Track progress in a structured way
- Improve problem-solving and logical thinking

## 🧠 Rule I Follow
