# Age Validator with Loop 

A Python program that repeatedly prompts for age until a valid value within a realistic range is entered.

## Features
- Continuously prompts for age until valid input is provided
- Validates age against realistic human lifespan (0-120)
- Handles edge cases like negative ages or unrealistic high ages
- Provides clear acceptance when valid age is entered
- Demonstrates input validation with boundary checking

## Concepts Used
- Integer input handling and type conversion
- While loops with compound conditions
- Logical operators (`or`) for multiple validation criteria
- Comparison operators (`<=`, `>`, `or`)
- Input validation patterns

## How to Run
```bash
python age_validator.py
