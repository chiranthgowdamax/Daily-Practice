# Username Validator with Loop 

A Python program that repeatedly prompts for a username until it meets length requirements.

## Features
- Continuously prompts for username until valid length is provided
- Validates against empty usernames (length 0)
- Enforces maximum length constraint (15 characters)
- Provides acceptance confirmation when valid username is entered
- Demonstrates string length validation in a loop

## Concepts Used
- String input handling
- `len()` function for string length measurement
- While loops with compound conditions
- Logical operator (`or`) for multiple validation criteria
- String validation patterns
- Comparison operators

```bash
python username_validator.py
